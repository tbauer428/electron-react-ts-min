# electron-webpack-typescript-react-quick-start
> A bare minimum project structure to get started developing with [`electron-webpack`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-webpack), react and typescript.

Thanks to the power of `electron-webpack` this template comes packed with...

* Use of [`webpack-dev-server`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) for development
* HMR for both `renderer` and `main` processes
* Use of [`babel-preset-env`](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env) that is automatically configured based on your `electron` version
* Use of [`electron-builder`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) to package and build a distributable electron application

Make sure to check out [`electron-webpack`'s documentation](https://webpack.electron.build/) for more details.

I have then added to electron webpack...

* Type declarations with Typescript
* UI framework with React
* Styling with SASS
* Code formatting with Prettier
* Linting with Eslint

## Getting Started
Simply clone down this repository, install dependencies, and get started on your application.

The use of the [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager is **strongly** recommended, as opposed to using `npm`.

```bash
# copy template using git clone
git clone https://github.com/sweeetland/electron-typescript-react.git
cd electron-typescript-react
rm -rf .git

# install dependencies
yarn
```

### Development Scripts

```bash
# run application in development mode
yarn dev

# compile source code and create webpack output
yarn compile

# `yarn compile` & create build with electron-builder
yarn dist

# `yarn compile` & create unpacked build with electron-builder
yarn dist:dir
```
